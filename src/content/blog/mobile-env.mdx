import Tooltip from "../../components/Tooltip.astro";

Setting up a cross-platform mobile environment, especially for React Native,
is <Tooltip initialText="type 3 fun" hoverText="not fun at all" />.
I try to update this as frequently as possible, but as always your mileage may vary.

This guide assumes you are on a Mac. If you're on Windows, that's a personal problem. To get a deeper sense of what I'm working with, you can check out my [machine config](/blog/dev-env) as a whole.

This guide is written as project-agnostic as possible and there will be notes that project-specific configurations will be needed.

## 0. Install Xcode CLI Tools

If you've installed Homebrew already and have downloaded packages using it, you've probably already done this step.

Before anything else, you must install the **Xcode Command Line Tools**. To check if you have them installed already, run:

```bash
xcode-select --print-path
```

If this returns empty, you need to install the tools.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## 1. Install Packages

Using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> (or whatever your preferred package manager), you'll need the following packages:

```bash
brew install gnupg applesimutils git node watchman fastlane aria2
```

I also recommend <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dotenvx</a> for handling environment variables. It can be installed globally as well.

```bash
brew install dotenvx
```

## 3. iOS Setup

If you don't need iOS development, you can skip this step. I wouldn't.

### a. Install Xcode

I prefer the **<a href="https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xcodes</a>** library for Xcode version management.

```bash
brew install xcodes
```

Once installed, you can install the latest version of Xcode.

```bash
xcodes install --latest --no-superuser
```

After it installs, you'll need to accept the license agreement.

```bash
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### b. Add Apple Developer Certificates\*

For this step, you will need to have the following:

- An Apple Developer Account
- A project initialized and set up, either via EAS or Fastlane

Part of project initialization is generating certificates for developing your app. These certificates are project specific and need to be added to your keychain. 2 of these certificates need to be added to your keychain: 1 should have the `.cer` extension, the other `.p12`.

You can add these certificates to your keychain by double-clicking on them. You will be prompted to enter your password.

You can also add them from the command line:

```bash
# run from the directory where the certs are located

sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <certname>.cer

sudo security import <cert>.p12 -P <password> -A -t cert -f pkcs12 -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

If you have a project with many developers, I recommend [using dotenvx to manage certificates]().

### c. Install CocoaPods

Cocoapods is a dependency manager for iOS. It requires Ruby to be installed, so be sure your Ruby installation is not screwed up ~~as it usually is on a Mac~~.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### d. Install OS versions + create simulators

Using xcodes, we can install the latest versions of iOS and create simulators for them.

I also recommend installing the oldest version of iOS that's currently supported by Apple, here's a handy little script to do that:

```javascript
const { execSync } = require("child_process");

function getIosVersions() {
  const runtimesList = execSync("xcodes runtimes").toString();

  const runtimes = runtimesList
    .split("\n")
    .filter((runtime) => runtime.startsWith("iOS"))
    .map((runtime) =>
      runtime.includes("(") ? runtime.split("(")[0].trim() : runtime.trim()
    );

  return {
    latest: runtimes[runtimes.length] - 1,
    oldest: runtimes[0],
  };
}
```

Once you have the versions, you can install them with xcodes:

```bash
xcodes runtimes install <version> # e.g. 18.1
```

You can then create simulators with xcrun. When creating simulators, be sure the device version is cased properly.

```bash
xcrun simctl create "<name>" <version>
# e.g.
# xcrun simctl create "iPhone 15 Pro" 18.1
```

Your machine should now be (mostly) ready for iOS development, sans any project-specific needs.

## 3. Android Setup

### a. Install the Java JDK

Zulu 17 is the recommended JDK for Android development for React Native.

```bash
brew install --cask zulu@17
```

### b. Install Android Studio

For many years I tried to run headless Android Studio, but it's just not worth the headache. You can install the CLI tools separately, which I recommend but in addition to Android Studio itself.

```bash
brew install --cask android-studio android-commandlinetools
```

### c. Install SDK Manager and other tools

First, accept the license agreement

```bash
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
```

Then install the tools. Note that some versions may need to be changed depending on your projects needs.

```bash
sdkmanager "cmdline-tools;latest" "patcher;v4" "build-tools;30.0.2" "platforms;android-32" "emulator" "tools" "platform-tools" "ndk-bundle"
```

### d. Create emulators

You can create emulators using the AVD Manager in Android Studio, but I prefer to do it from the command line.

You'll need to know the version of Android you're targeting, as well as the device you want to emulate.

```bash
avdmanager create avd -n <name> -k "system-images;android-<version>;google_apis;x86_64" --device <device>

# e.g.
# avdmanager create avd -n "Pixel 6" -k "system-images;android-32;google_apis;x86_64" --device "pixel_6"
```

## 4. React Native / Expo Setup

At this point, your machine should be setup for native development. If you're using Expo, I highly recommend installing <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/build/orbit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expo Orbit</a>.

```bash
brew install --cask expo-orbit
```

From here, consult your project to take care of any specific needs.
